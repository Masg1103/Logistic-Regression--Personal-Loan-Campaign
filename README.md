# **Logistic-Regression--Personal-Loan-Campaign**

### **Background and Context**
AllLife Bank is a US-based financial institution experiencing growth in its customer base. The majority of its customers are individuals who deposit their funds, making them liability customers. However, only a small portion of these customers also utilize the bank's loan services, classifying them as asset customers. To further expand its loan business and generate increased interest revenue, the bank aims to convert liability customers into personal loan customers while retaining them as depositors.

Previous marketing campaigns conducted by the bank specifically targeting liability customers resulted in a successful conversion rate of over 9%. This positive outcome has inspired the retail marketing department to develop new campaigns that employ better target marketing strategies.

### **Objectives**
to determine whether a customer with liabilities will purchase a personal loan or not. Additionally, we aim to identify the variables that have the most impact on this decision and determine which segment of customers should be prioritized for targeting

### **Goal**
As a Data Scientist at AllLife Bank, the goal is to build a predictive model that assists the marketing department in identifying potential or liability customers with a higher probability of purchasing personal loans, ultimately driving the bank's loan business growth.
